# Catalog - Udacity
### Full Stack Web Development ND

## About
This is a Jewelry Catalog application that provides:
* a list of items within a variety of categories
* a user registration and authentication system
* Registered users will have the ability to:
    * post items
    * edit items
    * delete items

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need to install these software:
* Download and Install **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
* Download and Install **[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)**
* Download and Install **[VirtualBox 3](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)**
* Clone or Download the Github repository at 
    **(https://github.com/orlandocarnate/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)** 
    in your vagrant folder.


## Start the virtual machine
From your terminal, inside the *vagrant* subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM. If the shell prompt starts with the word `vagrant` then you are loggied into Linux VM.

## Install Flask and JSON

## Run the query program
Make sure you're in the `vagrant/catalog` folder within the Linux VM terminal. Enter 'ls' to see a list of items within the vagrant folder. You should see `project.py`.

In the Linux VM terminal run this command:
`python project.py`

## Template Style 
I copied the WCschools template and broke it down into separate templates.
