# Catalog - Udacity
### Full Stack Web Development ND

## About
This is a Jewelry Catalog application that provides:
* a list of items within a variety of categories
* a user registration and authentication system
* Registered users will have the ability to:
    * CReate new items
    * Update items
    * Delete items

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need to install these software:
* Download and Install **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
* Download and Install **[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)**
* Download and Install **[VirtualBox 3](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)**
* Clone or Download the Github repository at 
    **(https://github.com/orlandocarnate/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)** 
    in your vagrant folder.


## Start the virtual machine
From your terminal, inside the *vagrant* subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM. If the shell prompt starts with the word `vagrant` then you are loggied into Linux VM.

## Run the Python Web Server
Make sure you're in the `vagrant/catalog` folder within the Linux VM terminal. Enter 'ls' to see a list of items within the vagrant folder. You should see `project.py`.

In the Linux VM terminal run this command:
`python project.py`

## Template Style with Bootstrap
I probably spent half the time researching Bootstrap for my Flask templates. Below are some of the sites I have been researhing:
* **[GetBootstrap.com Examples](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/)**
* **[Tooplate.com Shelf Template](https://www.tooplate.com/live/2092-shelf)**
* **[W3schools.com Clothing Store Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_clothing_store.htm)**
* **[Startbootstrap.com Shop Homepage Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/shop-homepage/)**
